### Course goals and format

The aim of this course is to provide the basic Git knowledge necessary for Sigma2/Metacenter
staff. The focus will be on solving certain routine tasks based around GitLab and
learning tips and tricks along the way. We shall focus on how to get things done and best
practices rather than covering all the basics on Git.
